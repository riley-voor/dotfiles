We changed the name of the ".git" directory to "git-directory-backup" here so that git wouldn't complain about nested git directories for Vundle because we wanted Vundle to already be installed when this repo was cloned. If you want to update Vundle or do some other operation that required it to be connected to its git repo, you can rename the "git-directory-backup" directory back to ".git"
