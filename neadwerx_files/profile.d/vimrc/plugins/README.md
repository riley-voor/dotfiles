# Nead Werx Plugins #

These are a list of plugins that are beneficial to install and use at Nead Werx.
Some of these plugins have pre-defined settings that you can find in this
directory. While others are just recommended to be installed. Feel free to use
any plugin manager you prefer, and there are some recommendations below.

## Recommended Plugins: ##

    - EasyAlign (junegunn/vim-easy-align): super easy alignment on delimiters
    - Endwise (tpope/vim-endwise): automatically insert ending conditional statements for scripts
    - Fugitive (tpope/vim-fugitive): use git from inside of vim
    - Supertab (ervandew/supertab): smart autocompletion for tab
    - Syntastic (scrooloose/syntastic): syntax checking for php, perl, javascript, etc...
    - Tlib (tomtom/tlib_vim): helper plugin for ultisnips and supertab
    - Ultisnips (SirVer/ultisnips): insert often typed blocks of code

Note: If you are using Ultisnips or Supertab you *must* also use Tlib to make
them all work together.

Note: Nead Werx settings are available for the following plugins:

    - EasyAlign at '/etc/profile.d/vimrc/plugins/easy\_align.vim'
    - Syntastic at '/etc/profile.d/vimrc/plugins/syntastic.vim'
    - Ultisnips at '/etc/profile.d/vimrc/plugins/ultisnips.vim'
