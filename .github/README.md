It has to be a linux machine

This repository has to be in your users home directory or you need to manually copy the files to you the home directory.

LINK FOR MAKING VIM FOLDS MORE USABLE

LINK FOR SCRATCHPAD PLUGIN STUFF WHICH SEEMS COOL AND USEFUL:
  - https://hakin9.org/codi-vim-the-interactive-scratchpad-for-hackers/

LINK FOR LSP WHICH MAYBE COULD BE COOL?:
  - https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim

NOTE TO LOOK INTO STICKY SCROLLING FOR VIM

VIM IDEA: find a way to set up a shortcut to regex search for the word that the cursor is currently hovering over

neoclide/coc maybe useful for vim ctag finding type definitions etc.

look into some kind of AI plugin. Just wanna check it out in case I find something useful.

update bashrc with version from laptop
update vim stuff to have work vimrc and additional plugins


I'd eventually like this repo to work like this:
    - Clone this repository onto your machine then run the install.sh (TODO) script. This will backup the dotfiles and other config files that already exist on the machine, update the versions of the files in use to match the ones in this repository, and install all dependencies.
    - If you want to reset the machine back to the previous configuration then run the uninstall.sh (TODO) script.
